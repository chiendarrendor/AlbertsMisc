py 0.2

Usage: perl -w py2pl.sh <name>

py is yacc for perl (actually not yacc but bison ;-), ie. it reads
a grammer in yacc format with embedded perl code. To keep parsing
simple the following layout of the embedded code is used:

1  exprs:    expr
2       {
3         return "$_[0]";
4       } /* py */
5       | expr exprs
6       {
7         return "@_";;
8       } /* py */

The third and seventh line are embedded perl code, started by the
curly brace in line two and ended by the one in line four. The comment
after the closing brace is essential right now (adding a brace counting
parser is the next step)

py files are converted to y files using py2y.pl. This y file is feed
to bison, generating an output (I drop the c file in the script), which
is processed by a hacked py script also reading the py file to generate
a '$name.pl' and '$name-rules.pl' file.

'$name-main.pl' has to be provided by hand.

I'll hope You'll find this stuff useful and would enjoy hearing from You :-)
