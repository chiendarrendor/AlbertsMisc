Hi again!

Thanks for Your prompt and kind reply concerning Your perl yacc script.
I've to admit that I could not resist hacking it a bit and won't
hesitate
to hand You the result of kinda programming weekend.

I hope You'll find time to give it a glance and maybe You even may find
it useful, in which case I'd be glad to hear from You :-)

Best regards

Knud Werner
