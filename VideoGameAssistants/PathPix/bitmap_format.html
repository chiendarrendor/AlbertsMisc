<h1>Windows Bitmap File Format</h1>
<h2>Purpose of Document</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Explaining the Windows File Format to sufficient detail for implementation of methods for reading and writing with the format.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>File Header</h2>

 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>38</td><td>bytes</td><td>Bytes with value 0.  For file reading, use the file header size value given earlier to determine where the pixel data starts.  For file writing, just leave 16 bytes with a value of 0 here.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>54</td><td>4-byte int [] for palettes</td>
  <td>If colour palettes are used(bit depth 1,4,8), this would be the first entry.  If not, this is the beginning of pixel data.</td>
 </tr>

<h2>Bit Depth</h2>
<table>
 <tr>
  <th>Bit Count</th>
  <th>Description</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>Each pixel's colour is indicated by a 1-bit index into a colour palette of only 2<sup>1</sup> or 2 colours.  This is also referred to as "monochrome."  Use bit shifting and masking to access each bit efficiently.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>Each pixel's colour is indicated by a 4-bit index into a colour palette of 2<sup>4</sup> or 16 colours.  Use bit shifting and masking to access each 4-bit index efficiently.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>8</td>
  <td>Each pixel's colour is indicated by an 8-bit index into a colour palette of 2<sup>8</sup> or 256 colours</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>16</td>
  <td>5 bits for each RGB value.  The 16th bit is unused but should be left 0.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>24</td>
  <td>8 bits for each RGB value.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>32</td>
  <td>8 bits for each RGB value.  The extra byte is sometimes used to indicate an alpha blending ratio when drawing the image over another one.</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br />
<h2>Colour Palettes</h2>
<p>Colour palettes are used for bit depths of 1, 4, and 8.  The entries follow a 32-bit format starting 54 bytes into the file or where pixel data usually starts for bit depths above 8.</p>
<br />
<h2>Pixel Data Padding</h2>
<p>
Each row of pixels must occupy a multiple of 4 bytes.  When this doesn't happen, 1 to 3 extra bytes of unimportant values are appended to the end of each row of pixel data.
</p>
<br />
<h2>Compression</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Compression is very rarely used with bitmap files so you don't have to worry much about not supporting any.</li>
</ul>
