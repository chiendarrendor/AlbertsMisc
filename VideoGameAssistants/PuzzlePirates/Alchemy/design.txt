GA library:
given a factory for constructing individuals (template?)
and some additional scalar properties:

1. create a random population of specified size
2. for the specified number of generations:
   a. determine the fitness of each current member
   b. create a new empty population
   c. as many times as the specified size:
      1. choose two members of the existing population,
	 randomly weighted by that member's fitness as
	 a fraction of the sum total fitness.
      2. copy one member, cross it over with the other
      3. if random(0,1) < specified mutation percentage,
	 mutate the copied and crossovered member.
      4. insert this new member into the new population
   d. make the new population the current population

Alchemy board:
specify colors at the top (Y,R,B,Q) and the bottom 
(Y,R,B,V,O,G) (special vertical pipes)
specify pipes in the middle

Individual pipe cells know how many distinct rotations
they have, and how many different pipes they have.

The individual for the GA library is a specification
of one distinct rotation for each cell in the board.
